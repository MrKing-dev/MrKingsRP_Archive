I'm going assume that Becca is pushing this BEAST to the limits of what it can handle under the circumstances.  Therefore, you guys have approximately 15 minutes of IG time for any conversations that need to happen on the way.  Be mindful of others Discord time limitations, please.  I will be happy to RP Mighty Pines if need be.  Also, any interactions with the car can be made in this time if need be.  Let me know what you need.",

It's classic Ian and classic Inverness - a 3.5 star hotel playing at a 5 star experience, the veneer of luxury with a bit of an aftertaste.  Just down the street are a few parks where families like to walk, some hair salons, and a primary school.  Prince Ian and his crew live in the \"Kingsclub Rooms\", a separate section of the hotel that Ian calls \"The Presidential Suite\"  (that's not what it's called https://www.kingsmillshotel.com/our-rooms/kingsclub-rooms/).  In reality, you think Ian likes it because the name \"King\" is in it.*",

It is my feeling that things would work out best if we began Friday where we left off last week.  If you feel strongly that we should take care of the car via Discord, please react with the car.  If you are ok with waiting to handle things on Friday, react with Fluttershy.))",

She knows she'll need a minimum of 5 successes to get an actual stake (those are the rules), so she stacks the deck.

FIrst, I'll go over the timeline to get our head's straight.  Second, I'll discuss the ball location and vampire travel concerns.  Third, we'll deal with feeding.  \n\nFor timeline, I'm going to use dates as the date the evening you wake up.  I feel as if this simplifies things.  Therefore:\n\nNov. 30:  The mages touch base, you head to the distillery, you meet the werewolves, Ian takes the pub, you go to Max's apartment, you acquire new equipment.\n\nDec. 1: The team plans to overthrow Ian.  Becca and Zahir wash the car.  The team observes the pub via the security cameras\n\nDec 2:  The team attacks, Becca finds she's an excellent shot, Regina et. al. deliver a message from her father, they inherit a castle.\n\nDec. 3:  TBA\n\nDec. 4:  A celebratory ball is planned at Osterly House Estate in London.\n\nOsterly House is on the outskirts of London.  When the team looks into travel, they'll find they essentially have three options.  \n\n1.  Drive.  It takes 9 hours and 45 minutes to drive from Inverness to Osterly House.  They're expected at 8pm on Dec. 4th.  This is the safest option, but also the longest.  This option would pack them all in a car for a long time.  Also, they'd have to be careful not to draw attention.  The time listed above is for using highways - back roads would take longer.\n\n2. Train.  It takes 8 hours and 30 minutes via train to get to London.  They will send a car to pick you up at the train station. This option is faster, but does coop you up in a train for a long time.  You'll need to make sure you aren't hungry!!  Also, that you don't act dumb.\n\n3. Plane.  It's 1 hour and 30 minutes on a plane to get to London.  This option also requires *vampires* to get through *airport security*. Not to mention being cooped up in a flying box. Usually doesn't go well.  ))",

No matter how much Becca enjoys driving, 10 hours of driving is exhausting in any circumstance, and she is NOT trusting anyone but herself with Peregrine's car. So, she would probably plan to take the train on December 3rd at around 10 PM (that gives them 10 hours to get to the castle where the ball will be held before it gets light). They will then spend the following day sleeping at the castle, and wake up in time the next night to explore and get ready for the ball.\n\nNow, Becca offers two options regarding travel (and since this travel is at night, everyone will be naturally awake for it):\n\n1) Anyone who is below 7 humanity HAS to use a vitae to look more humanlike and blend in with the people on the train (this applies to Moonshine and Max). The goal here is to look as natural as possible and blend in.\n\n2. The stake method. Becca lines the vampires up on a wall and shoots anyone willing in the chest with a wooden arrow (this can either be because you think it's a funny method of travel that your character would pursue, you don't want to spend a vitae, you are hungry for some reason, or you just think your character would be too nervous to travel on a train). Then, she puts them in a wooden crate and loads them as train cargo. She takes them out of torpor when they get to the castle (or at another convenient time), and tada, you are in London.\n\nKeep in mind that Mr. King intends to start our next session at the ball, so any roleplay anyone would want to do regarding the trip would have to be done before then via Discord. Still, please let me know here your character's decisions so that you either adjust your vitae accordingly, or everyone just knows how they all got there. Thanks!))",

As he approaches them, he collapses in a heap, his forehead mark searing pain throughout his body, blacking him out.  Before anyone can react, the revenant claps her hands and the townsfolk accompanying her, Moonshine, and the revenant herself disappear in a flash of blue light.\n\nOnce they recover from the shock, the three remaining members of the team (Channard, Max, and Becca) realize that they are outnumbered and outclassed, with a second injured teammate.  They decide to head back to the pub to regroup with Zahir, to heal, and to catch their collective breaths.*\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere:\n\n*Moonshine is out for about an hour.  During the end of this time, he drifts in and out with a piercing headache, violent nausea, and a hunger like he's never felt before.  He hears voices, but cannot make out what they are saying.  He cannot move.  \n\nHe then starts gaining a small amount of clarity, but still cannot see.  He smells blood (food) but is unable to reach it, he feels steel at his wrists, arms, ankles, neck, and more.  He hears voices again:*\n\n\"And why is this process necessary?\"  \"The first step of the process is to draw out the beast - we must bring him to his most primal. To that end - torture as only a vampire can know it.\"\n\n*Moonshine feels an electric shock course through his body, starting at his forehead mark.  He collapses inward, focusing on his Auspex abilities, condensing all willpower left within on a singular goal of reaching out...*",
