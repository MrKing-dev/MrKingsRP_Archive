Everything in his mind was shattering, fractured into thousands of pieces of broken glass that Max kept pushing further into him with each step. As soon as he got back to his room, he finally broke. Max ripped the room apart- anything that wasn't nailed down was destroyed. He was screamed, loud, anguished. No one dare enter the room; not when Max was like this. Any werewolf or ghoul nearby quickly scurried away at the outburst. When the room was barren, with only destroyed splinters of wood and shattered picture frames littering the floor, Max finally crumbled into a pile on the floor. He would have thrown up if it was possible, and the blood from his untreated wounds dribbled to the ground, pooling there. As the noise died down from the room, outside, only the darest braved the halls outside Max's room.",

Although she knew something was wrong, she hadn't quite expected *that* reaction. Clearly, she had to try and help, even if her sense of self-preservation was telling her that was a bad idea. Quietly, Becca padded into one of the other rooms in the hallway and snagged a blanket off of one of the beds, reminding herself that she had to be sure it got put back and the bed remade once she was done.\n\nAs she walked to the room, she tried to remain calm and collected. This wasn't going to work if she made even the slightest error. Blanket slung over her shoulder, Becca opened the door slowly and walked into the room, giving Max a wide berth. She noted his condition with concern, before settling to the floor at the furthest point she could from where Max's person and his belongings were strewn. She tried to keep her hands within sight at all times, and avoided direct eye contact.",

From his curled-up position on the floor, his eyes locking onto her moving figure, his gaze like that of a rabid animal. His figure shook slightly as she approached, even if she didn't get close. It wasn't of fear though, no, that familiar tensing of muscles, anyone could see he was ready to go on the defensive at any second. It was almost like he didn't even recognize her until she spoke, her soft voice filling his ears. \n\nAt first, Max said nothing. She had seen him like *this*, broken, unstable, though by this point, who even cares?? The whole castle already thought him a monster, if not before, definitely now by his outburst. Keira did. ***Keira hated him***, oh god, she hit him, it was all his fault. \n\n***\"YOU LEFT US!! YOU'RE A COWARD!!\" ***\n\nThe words spun in his head as he stared Becca down. God, Becca must have hated him. Keira was right. He is a coward; a selfish, disgusting coward, a monster. He'd almost killed Moonshine, he would have if Becca never stood up to him. And now he's laying on the floor, in a pool of his own blood, looking up to one of the most forgiving people he's ever met. If Ian had ever known about Max's violent outbursts, he would surely be staked by now, left to rot in a decrepit basement. \n\nBut when he looked into Becca's eyes, he didn't see any judgment, or anger, or disgust. No, Becca's eyes were filled with only compassion, worry, with a presence that could only be described as one thing. \n\n*~~Safe.~~*",

With how much stress the whole team had been experiencing recently, she had been worried that the sound of breaking objects in the room had connected directly to the shattering of any last senses of control Max had. This, though; she could work with this.\n\nThe direct method had not worked in the past, Becca recognized now as she considered her next moves. As much as she desperately wanted to rush over to Max and smother him in the blanket she had brought, she knew better now. Instead, she opted to let him open up to her in his own timing.\n\n\"You can tell me whatever you need, Max, and I'll do anything I can to help. If you want me to just sit here, I can do that. If you want me to come over and give you this blanket I brought, I can do that, too. Whatever you need.\"\n\nWith that, Becca leaned back against the wall behind her and began quietly humming. The move was Max's, now. All she could do was wait for him to decide how much help he wanted.",

No, the person he was before the team, before Ian, would have been horrified with who he had become. \n\nMaybe that was a good thing. \n\nMaybe it wasn't. \n\nHe didn't know. \n\nAll Max knew was that he was just tired. \n\nHe was so, so, tired. \n\nSo he did the only thing his brain was telling him to do. \n\nHe wrapped his arms around Becca, and he began to weep.",

I probably should get a different one to wear out on missions though, I'm worried that someday my luck with it will run out.\"\n\nBecca carefully pulled her head away from Max's own shoulder to look at the gashes on his face, sorrow crossing her own. She couldn't even imagine what he had said to Peregrine to cause that kind of reaction to be warranted. Her one hand reached up and ghosted across the side of his face, careful to avoid the wounds as she let concern and curiosity show in her expression.",
