I probably should try to get back up to my bed in the haven. Do you think you can handle...\" Becca ever so slightly gestured to the rubble.

Their Nightmare ability allows them to prey on others fears and cause them to shut down. Their weapons are mostly cheap Russian imports (Ian struggled for a long time to get weapons, then found a supplier in the Ukraine). This means that they only fire in full auto. It also means they're unreliable. In game terms, this means they don't reroll 10s and 1s subtract from successes.",
