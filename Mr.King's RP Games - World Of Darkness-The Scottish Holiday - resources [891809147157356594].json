General décor in the long-abandoned station indicates roughly the 1920's and signs in the lobby mention \"Inverness Central Loop Underground\" and \"Raigmore Station.\"  Your Gang's resident investigator and general sleuth Moonshine filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the local Transportation Authority and was given the attached map.  He also learned that, after the success of the London Underground and the Glasgow Ring, Inverness decided to start building their own subway in the 1920's.  They got three stations built and some display trains set up before the Great Depression brought the project to a shuddering halt.  The stations have been boarded up and ignored since.",

We all started at 7, but as roleplay has gone on, I believe that each character is unique and has presented as having unique Humanity.  I have avoided Humanity rolls to this point because I've been working on deciding how I wanted to handle this.  I'm going to list below where I believe each character should be on the Humanity chart (as of the beginning of the game) and what that represents as described in the book.  I'll also give a broad overview of how Humanity generally impacts gameplay.\n\nCharacters with high humanity can mingle and interact with humans well.  They can act as liasons, etc.  Characters with 8-10 do this effortlessly, characters with 7 do it with some struggle.  As a tradeoff, they are more subject to degeneration rolls when they do \"bad things.\" \n\nCharacters with low humanity rolls are not as subjected to degeneration rolls - they're not as bothered by the things they have to do to *survive*. As a tradeoff, they look generally less than human and can't pass as human without spending a Vitae to do so.\n\nI believe Becca should be an 8:  Kindred with Humanity scores this high can seem “more\nhuman than human.” Neonates might recoil from their own monstrosity and take up ethical codes stricter than any they followed in life. They usually try to feed only from animals or seek other alternatives to victimizing mortals, and feed as little as possible in any case. They don’t have to act preachy or passively accept everything that unlife and their fellow Kindred throw at them, but they must work hard to avoid harming anyone else and to atone for any sin they commit. Interaction with mortals often matters a great deal to such Kindred, as interacting with the living helps them remember what life was like. They can also pass for mortal almost without effort.\n\nI believe Zahir should be a 6 or 7:",

We've had a lot of character development recently, and I've also noticed that some people struggle more than others to understand what their character does or would do or feels in a particular situation.  I'm not going to require anyone to do this - but I highly suggest that anyone who feels up to it take 5-10 questions from each category (there are 365 questions total - that's a lot!) and use them to help better understand your character",
